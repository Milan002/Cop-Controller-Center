The web controller application serves as a dynamic command center, empowering users with the authority to efficiently manage law enforcement operations. Through its intuitive interface and seamless integration of Google Maps, the controller wields the capability to swiftly assign police officers to designated locations and dispatch them to areas requiring immediate attention. This functionality enables real-time decision-making and resource allocation, ensuring optimal deployment of personnel to address emergent situations effectively.

The CCC app provides law enforcement officers with a comprehensive toolset for streamlined communication and coordination. Officers can easily request backup, view their assigned deployments, and receive real-time updates on emerging incidents.

Each component of the system(CCC_app,CCC_backend and CCC_web) is accompanied by its own README file housed within its respective folder, providing clear instructions for setup and execution. Additionally, it is essential to note that setting up the system requires Google Maps API keys for location services and access, as well as creating a MongoDB database for data storage and retrieval. The Google Maps API keys and mongoDB database credentials must be substituted as stated.
